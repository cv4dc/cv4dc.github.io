   abstract: "Abstract: TBA"
   bio: "Before settling down in Rayong, he was a research resident at Google Brain working on geometric understanding in deep learning and image synthesis. Supasorn Suwajanakorn finished his Ph.D. from University of Washington working with Prof. Steve Seitz and Prof. Ira Kemelmacher in Graphics-Vision group GRAIL. His goal is to bring computer vision out of the lab into the real world and make it really work in the wild."

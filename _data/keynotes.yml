   title: "Vision Research from An Unknown Corner of The World"
   abstract: "Starting a research lab in computer vision in a country with little existing research in the field comes with unique and fun challenges. In this talk, I will share my journey of founding a research group at VISTEC, Thailand. This isn’t a story of having everything figured out—it’s more like a Netflix series filled with constant struggles, small victories, and plenty of episodes yet to come. Picture students diving into computer vision research without ever having taken a vision course during their undergrad, or trying to research diffusion models using 16GB GPUs, now painfully referred to as “potatoes.” Our institute’s remote, forested location further adds to the challenge of building connections and visibility. Through these experiences, we’ve built a lab culture focused on creativity, collaboration, and making the most of what we have. This talk will share lessons learned from working in this unconventional setting."
   bio: "Supasorn Suwajanakorn is currently a lecturer at the School of Information Science and Technology (IST), VISTEC, Thailand. He received a B.Eng. degree from Cornell University in 2011 and a Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 2017, where he won the William Chan Memorial Dissertation Award and was invited to speak about his thesis at TED2018. Before joining VISTEC, he spent a year as a research resident at Google Brain. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and computer graphics."

   title: "AI and Systems Design for Marine Challenges"
   abstract: "In this talk, I will explore the pivotal role of AI in tackling the challenges of visual understanding in the marine environment. In particular, I will introduce the concept of marine AI foundation models—large-scale pre-trained systems designed for marine visual understanding. These models aim to capture the unique characteristics of underwater environments and serve as a universal system for various visual understanding tasks, such as coral reef monitoring, biodiversity assessment, marine species monitoring, and underwater navigation. Additionally, I will discuss several ongoing projects focused on achieving accurate underwater 3D mapping. The research I will present contributes to interdisciplinary efforts across maritime planning, large-scale seafloor surveying and cleaning, fishery management, marine life monitoring, underwater trash cleaning, and advancing AI applications in marine science and technology."
   bio: "Sai-Kit Yeung is a Professor at the Division of Integrative Systems and Design (ISD), the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and the Department of Ocean Science (OCES) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Before joining HKUST, he was an Assistant Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and founded the Vision, Graphics and Computational Design (VGD) Group. During his time at SUTD, he was also a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. Prior to that, he had been a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Prof. Yeung’s research interests include 3D vision and graphics, content generation, fabrication, novel computational techniques and integrative systems for marine-related problems. He has published extensively in premier computer vision and graphics venues, including numerous full oral papers in CVPR, ICCV, and AAAI. His work has received best paper honorable mention awards at ICCP 2015 and 3DV 2016. Prof. Yeung has been actively serving as a senior committee member in major AI, computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics conferences. These include roles as a Senior Program Committee member for IJCAI 2021 and AAAI 2021 and 2022, an Area Chair for ICCV 2023, CVPR 2023, 2024, and 2025, and NeurIPS 2024, as well as an Associate Editor (Robot Learning) for ICRA 2024 and 2025. He also served as Course Chair for SIGGRAPH Asia 2019 and regularly contributes as a Technical Papers Committee member for Eurographics, SIGGRAPH, and SIGGRAPH Asia. Currently, he is an Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)."

   title: "Research Journey with Talented Students from Developing Countries"
   abstract: "In this talk, I would like to share the research cooperation, achievements, and non-research experiences while advising international students from developing countries in graduate school over the past 10 years. Our research group currently consists of 50% local students and 50% international students, mainly from Indonesia. They are excellent students with the right character, passion for research, and an active cooperative mindset, and they performed highly productive and high-level research during their degree. I feel quite fortunate to be able to work with these students. By sharing various success stories and few counter-examples, I hope that this talk will be helpful to researchers in developing countries and those in developed countries who will collaborate with each other."

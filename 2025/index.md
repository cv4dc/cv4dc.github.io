The 2nd Workshop on Computer Vision for Developing Countries (CV4DC) will be held in-person **in conjunction with ICCV 2025 in Honolulu, Hawaii** on **December 18, 2025**.

We invite students and researchers from developing countries, regardless of their current location, to submit their work to the 2nd Workshop on Computer Vision for Developing Countries (CV4DC). The workshop aims to highlight research that is either conducted in or particularly relevant to developing regions, spanning new ideas, ongoing projects, practical applications, and previously published work (within the last year).

CV4DC seeks to foster collaboration, inclusion, and impact in the global vision community by showcasing contributions that address local and global challenges. Participation is open to all, but we strongly encourage highlighting contributions from researchers affiliated with developing countries—especially the presenting author—in the abstract.

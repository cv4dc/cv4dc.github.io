 - name: "Supasorn Suwajanakorn"
   title: "Lecturer, VISTEC, Thailand"
   abstract: "Abstract: TBA"
   bio: "Before settling down in Rayong, he was a research resident at Google Brain working on geometric understanding in deep learning and image synthesis. Supasorn Suwajanakorn finished his Ph.D. from University of Washington working with Prof. Steve Seitz and Prof. Ira Kemelmacher in Graphics-Vision group GRAIL. His goal is to bring computer vision out of the lab into the real world and make it really work in the wild."

 - name: "Sai-Kit Yeung"
   title: "Professor, Division of Integrative Systems and Design, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"
   abstract: "Abstract: TBA"
   bio: "Before joining HKUST, he was an Assistant Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and founded the Vision, Graphics and Computational Design (VGD) Group. During his time at SUTD, he was also a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. Prior to that, he had been a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He was a visiting student at the Image Processing Research Group at UCLA in 2008 and the Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands in 2007. He received his Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering, M.Phil. degree in Bioengineering, and B.Eng. degree (First Class Honors) from HKUST, respectively in 2009, 2005 and 2003. Dr. Yeung's research expertise is in computer vision and computer graphics. His current research interests include 3D contents (scene and shape) reconstruction, understanding, modeling, and redesign, as well as computational design (using AI techniques for design and content generation), computational fabrication, visual understanding, and human-AI interaction."

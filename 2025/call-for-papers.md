We invite students and researchers from **developing countries**, regardless of their current location, to submit their work to the **2nd Workshop on Computer Vision for Developing Countries (CV4DC)**. The workshop aims to highlight research that is either conducted in or particularly relevant to developing regions, spanning new ideas, ongoing projects, practical applications, and previously published work (within the last year).

CV4DC seeks to foster collaboration, inclusion, and impact in the global vision community by showcasing contributions that address local and global challenges. Participation is open to all, but we strongly encourage highlighting contributions from researchers affiliated with developing countries—especially the presenting author—in the abstract.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on a broad range of topics in computer vision and pattern recognition, including but not limited to:
- Vision for social good / global development
- Vision applications in agriculture, healthcare, climate change, disaster response, education
- Dataset development and annotation in low-resource settings
- Low-power and efficient computer vision
- Remote sensing, photogrammetry for developing regions
- Document analysis (e.g., handwritten, multilingual, low-quality)
- Biomedical image analysis and diagnostics
- Generative models and data augmentation for scarce data
- Vision + Language / Multimodal Learning
- Any core vision topics, including:
    - 3D Computer Vision
    - Motion and Tracking
    - Recognition, Categorization, Retrieval
    - Segmentation and Grouping
    - Deep Learning Techniques
    - Optimization and Statistical Methods
    - Low-Level Vision & Image Processing
    - Robotics, Autonomous Systems
    - Fairness, Transparency, and Ethics in CV

## Submission Tracks

We offer two submission tracks:

### 1. Proceedings Track
- Format: Up to 8 pages (excluding references), following ICCV 2025 formatting guidelines.
- Submissions will be double-blind reviewed.
- Accepted papers will be published in the official ICCV 2025 Workshop Proceedings.
- Suitable for well-developed, original research contributions.

### 2. Non-Proceedings Track
- Format: 2–4 pages (excluding references), following ICCV 2025 formatting guidelines.
- Welcomes work-in-progress, preliminary findings, insightful negative results, opinion pieces, novel datasets, and papers published within the last year.
- Submissions in this track will not be included in the official ICCV proceedings, allowing authors to share their work without affecting eligibility for journal or conference publication elsewhere.
- Suitable for researchers seeking community feedback, visibility, and collaboration opportunities on evolving or recently completed work.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submission portal: [**Proceedings Track**](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2025/Workshop/CV4DC_Proceedings) and [**Non-Proceedings Track**](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2025/Workshop/CV4DC_Non-Proceedings)
- All submissions must be uploaded via OpenReview.
- Templates and author kit available via ICCV 2025 Author Guidelines
- Reviews will be double-blind. All accepted papers will be presented in a poster session, and a select number will be chosen for oral presentations.

The Computer Vision for Developing Countries (CV4DC) Workshop will be held in-person **in Hanoi, Vietnam** on **December 08, 2024**.

The Computer Vision for Developing Countries (CV4DC) workshop at ACCV 2024 aims at creating a supportive environment where students / researchers in the field of computer vision and related areas in AI can connect with each other, share their latest work, and expand their network for potential future collaborations and mentorships. This workshop empowers students and researchers from underrepresented, developing countries by providing opportunities to network, learn from the field experts, and share their work. We believe giving opportunities to students and researchers from lesser-known countries will foster diversity in computer research, leading to richer and more innovative contributions to the field.
